# L3DTE-2023-AS91907
### Why?
This project for my final year of highschool for Digital Technologies class. <br>
Specifically, the AS91907 internal standard [pdf file](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91907.pdf).<br>
> ***Note:*** This was a project from 2023, github has preserved this project like a mosquito fossilized in tree sap.<br>

### What?
The project is to "Use complex processes to develop a digital technologies outcome".<br>
This involves project management and iterative designing, testing and manufacturing something with hardware and software components.<br>
The actual project is *intended* to be a toy car with two driving wheels and a slip-dome.<br>

Instead of remote control, the user inputs the instructions on the panel located at the top of the (cuboid) toy.
- There are 4 direction buttons to drive $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ and $\circlearrowleft$ and $\circlearrowright$ in a '+' formation.<br>
- There is a 'GO' button to start executing the commands at the centre of the '+' formation of directional buttons.<br>
- A switch to turn the toy on and off.

> ***Note:*** The project logs and documentation were nuked with my school google-drive account.
